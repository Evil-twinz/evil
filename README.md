<h1>Hacker Page with Interactive Globe - Demonstrating Common Vulnerabilities</h1>

This project simulates a "hacked" page with an interactive 3D globe and dynamic IP address display. It is hosted publicly at https://evil-twinz.github.io/evil/ and serves as a demonstration of common web vulnerabilities, such as Open URL Redirection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other security flaws.

The page showcases the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third-party libraries like Mapbox and amCharts. The globe rotates dynamically, and the page content presents a "hacked" environment for educational purposes.
Features

    Interactive Globe: A rotating 3D globe powered by amCharts that showcases world map data. The globe continuously rotates, offering an engaging visual experience.
    
    IP Address Display: Dynamically fetches and displays the user's IP address (via jsonip.com) in the page content, simulating the collection of user information in a "hacked" environment.
    
    Common Vulnerabilities Demonstrated:
        Open URL Redirection: Manipulate URLs to show how an attacker can redirect a victim to a malicious site.
        XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Demonstrates how malicious scripts can be injected into the page to compromise security.
        Other Security Flaws: The page is designed to showcase common web vulnerabilities for educational purposes.
        
    Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes. The globe and content are displayed seamlessly across devices.
